# Crowdfunding_ETL
To begin on this project we took information from the crowdfunding.xlsx spreadsheet and created a DataFrame using the data. From there we created two new DataFrames, one for the categories/category_id and another for the subcategories/subcategory_id. A CSV file was saved for both the category (category.csv) and subcategory (subcategory.csv) DataFrames, Next, using the same spreadsheet we created a DataFrame for all of the campaign information. This was then merged with both the category and subcategory Dataframes that were previously created. This was then used to create a new CSV file (campaign.csv). Moving on, the second spreadsheet (contacts.xlsx) was used to create a new DataFrame. This data was then manipulated to be more accessible and for readability. It was then converted into a CSV file as well (contacts.csv).

After these steps were taken, we created a database to store all of this information using PostgreSQL. After creating tables for each category using the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file that we created, the data was then imported from each CSV file that was previously extracted.
